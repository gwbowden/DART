In that directory, I also have two other programs:
1) create_track_obs_interactive.f90
to create hurricane vortex position and intensity  obs_seq
2) create_sat_wind_obs.f90
convert MADIS satellite wind netcdf file to obs_seq.
Ryan may have similar program, and he has better thinning
function than I do. My thinning algorithm is simply to take
one every N obs.

Hui made some changes to the GTS converter as he mentioned
earlier. I need to go over them with him before I can adapt his changes.
His code is under
/blhome/hliu/CWB/DART/models/wrf/CYS_NEW
