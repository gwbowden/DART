CESM1_5_setup_advanced:
This commitment is a preliminary version 
based on a development tag, cesm1_5_alpha02d, which has not been extensively tested.
There are extensive changes due to CESM1_5's move to perl and xml files for all setup and run scripts,
and keeping all of that in the new cime directory.  
The new CESM scripts incorporate an optional call to data assimilation after each forecast.
CESM1_5 accommodates running multiple cycles in each job, with the st_archive run as a 
separate single processor job after each CESM_DART job (not after each cycle).  
Job resubmission is still controlled by RESUBMIT.

This version also has support for using a non-standard grid, which we may want to keep in
...setup_advanced, but won't want in ...setup_hybrid.

Details:
> ccsmgetenv has been replaced by numerous xmlquery commands.
> The CESM run, submit, archive, ... scripts no longer have $CASE in their names.
  They're called case.run, ...
> Cesm_setup has been replaced by case.setup.
> CESM batch job characteristics (queue, account, ...) are now controlled by env_batch.xml,
  so those values are set with xmlchange calls, rather than editing case.run, case.st_archive, ...
> (no_)assimilate.csh is chosen by providing its full pathname to env_run.xml,
  rather than by editing case.run, which was the method in pre-CESM1_5.
> CESM's st_archive now handles DART output, which is controlled by the new env_archive.xml.
  So an st_archive modified for DART should not be copied to $CASEROOT.

-------------------
CESM1_5_DART_config:
CESM1_5 has a mechanism (env_run.xml:DATA_ASSIMILATION*) for running a data assimilation script 
after the forecast.  This removes the need for all of the pieces of ...DART_config which modified 
CESM scripts to do DA.

--------------
assimilate.csh:
? Should be called assimilate1_5.csh?
> New method (xmlquery) for getting CESM environment variables, 
  since they're not inherited from the new CESM1_5 perl scripts.
> Adapting the queries of input.nml to the new input.nml,
  which has multiple versions of some namelists ( or sections),
  all of which are commented out except one.  The greps in assimilate.csh
  were finding all of them, instead of the active one.  Inserting ^[ ]*
  in front of each search pattern does that.
