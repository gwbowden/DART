This is just a modification of a standard "text" converter that comes with DART.

<<<<<<< HEAD
It reads CHAMP and GRACE text Density files (which USED to be at
sisko.colorado.edu/sutton/data.html) and outputs DART obs_seq.out files.

Be aware that if obs_seq.out already exists, it optionally adds new
observations to that file without deleting it. This is done to allow
the wrapper script (work/convert.sh) to process sequentially numbered
Density_*.ascii files (read comments inside convert.sh).
If this is not the behavior you want, check the namelist option
&CHAMP_density_text_to_obs_nml:append_to_existing_file

The example file work/Density_3deg_02_335.ascii is truncated to 2 datapoints to
